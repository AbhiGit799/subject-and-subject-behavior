# subject-and-subject-behavior

Hi, <br/>
This is a simple Angular POC created by Abhishek Choubey. <br/>
In this POC I tried to demonstrate the usage of Rxjs Advance Observables, Subject and BehaviorSubject <br/>

<b> Short Description </b> </br>
The Rxjs Subject and BehaviorSubject are unique observables that act as both observers and observables. <br/> 
They allow us to emit new values to the observable stream using the next method. <br/>


Following components and services are created by me in this POC <br/>
ng g c parent <br/>
ng g c student <br/>
ng g c teacher <br/>
ng g s message <br/>

Software Used <br/>
node --version = v14.20.0 <br/>
npm --version = 6.14.17 <br/>
ng version <br/>
Angular CLI: 14.0.0 <br/>
